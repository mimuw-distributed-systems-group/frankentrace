# FrankenTrace
Low-Cost, Cycle-Level, Widely Applicable Program Execution Tracing for ARM Cortex-M SoC

This repository contains supplementary materials to the published research paper available at https://doi.org/10.1145/3576914.3587521.

## Abstract
Program execution tracing is an important technique in software development and analysis.
However, noninvasively obtaining cycle-level traces for modern low-power ARMv7-M-based SoCs is challenging, because convenient off-the-shelf high-speed tracing probes are expensive and cannot be applied to SoCs that lack high-speed debug components, notably Embedded Trace Macrocell (ETM) and parallel tracing port (PTP).
To address this issue, in this work, we present FrankenTrace, a technique for generating full, noninvasive, cycle-level program counter traces and full, cycle-level data transfer traces of varying invasiveness on SoCs with only low-speed debug components, namely Debug Watchpoint and Trace unit (DWT), Instrumentation Trace Macrocell (ITM), Single Wire Output (SWO), and an inexpensive probe.
We demonstrate the technique by tracing software running on a node of the 1KT testbed.

## About

Read [the open access FrankenTrace paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3576914.3587521) for a high-level overview of functionality and methods employed in FrankenTrace.
In short, FrankenTrace relies on repeated execution of **deterministic** application code to overcome the limitations of typical low-speed debug components (DWT and SWO).
Results of these re-executions are then stitched together (hence the name), to obtain a cycle-level trace of the program counter (PC, i.e., a trace of processor instructions) and data transfers from the processor to memory and peripherals.

Applications running on embedded microcontrollers (such as ARM Cortex-M), by their nature, typically are highly deterministic.
The non-determinism usually is a result of interaction of analog components (for instance, asynchronous low-frequency and high-frequency clocks) or variable user input.
The *on-device* FrankenTrace library provides re-execution synchronisation utility to be used in case of unavoidable non-determinism.

FrankenTrace consists of two main components:

- `device/` directory contains library functions to be executed on the embedded device to produce an ITM stream over SWO (essentially UART),
- `host/` directory contains scripts used to recreate a full cycle-level program execution trace from collected ITM events.

Moreover,

- `host/sigrok_decoders/` directory provides a utility to decode the ITM bytes stream to a CSV file with the events,
- `artifacts/` directory contains example applications with the recovered cycle-level traces.
